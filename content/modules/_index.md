<!--___Overview of EMOD and dtk simulation process.___</br> -->
_The figure shows from left to right the process of preparing a simulation over letting the simulation run to analyzing model outputs to receive results._
___Left side:__ When preparing a simulation, input files readable in EMOD (json format) need to be generated from data, often in format of prepared input csv files. In this step a single python is used to import relevant methods (functions) from `dtk-tools` and `dtk-tools-malaria` that 1) handle the conversion to json for input files, 2) builds the simulation scenario files and 3) submits the simulation to run automatically._
___Right side:__ After the simulation finished running one or more output files were generated by EMOD that describe transmission and disease or event related outcomes over time, per age bin or other categories selected. The analyzer functions from `dtk-tools` and `dtk-tools-malaria` are used again via import in a single python script ('Analyzer script') to obtain results in the format of csv files, summary tables or plots as specified._
