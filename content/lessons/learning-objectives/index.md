1b Describe the process required to model impact of malaria interventions in geographic-specific settings 

1c Compose relevant and feasible research questions in applied malaria modeling   

1d Design appropriate and feasible simulation experiments

### 2 Implement geographic-specific malaria modeling in EMOD  	

2a List major functionalities of EMOD

2b Independently install dtk-tools/dtk-tools-malaria and troubleshoot the installation process  

2c Demonstrate working knowledge of the different parts of an EMOD-handling script   by explaining the purpose of each part

2d Independently run simulations using dtk-tools scripts and plot outputs from HPC   

2e Extend simulation scripts with malaria interventions relevant to the research question and generate meaningful plots 

2f Calibrate a model setup to existing data by tuning modeled larval habitat availability or EIR to match observed prevalence

2g Examine simulation process and outputs to identify errors and apply troubleshooting measures as needed

3a Describe the goals of HBHI and the role of modeling in the HBHI process

3b Identify common features and/or approaches used in HBHI modeling and own research project   

### 4 Critically review methodologies and results of applied malaria modeling  	

4a Assess strengths and limitations of applied modeling approaches, for example strengths and limitations of data used and assumptions made in calibration and parameterization 

4b Identify areas of uncertainty in modeled outputs

4c Determine potential ways to better inform model inputs and analysis for future modeling work

### 5 Communicate applied modeling approaches and results to technical and non-technical audiences
