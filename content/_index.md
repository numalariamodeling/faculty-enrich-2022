title: Malaria Modeling Faculty Enrichment Program 2022
---

Malaria burden remains high in Sub-Saharan Africa despite two decades of intense intervention. Regular analysis and use of public health data will lead to more effective control through evidence-based decision making.

Our long-term goal is to train a critical mass of modeling scientists who are retained within Sub-Saharan Africa; training the next generation of modelers; working closely with local malaria control programs to provide operational support; competitive in obtaining grants from international funding agencies; and closely networked with each other across Africa and with international partners.
